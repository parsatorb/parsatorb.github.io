											"Through his work term, I had the pleasure of coordinating his work to improve and upgrade a variety of internal web-based software, while collaborating with another software development intern.<br>Parsa demonstrated considerable drive to achieve results. He was keen to complete assigned objectives, and took the initiative to make proposals for other shortcomings not detected in earlier planning. He was a sharp learner and was able to master new programming technologies very quickly. He worked well in a team environment. I would recommend Parsa to any organization seeking a bright and qualified software engineer."

											"At Sunnybrook, Parsa worked on building a user-friendly web-based visualization platform for the retrieval, display and analysis of medical images. He worked with great efficiency and with minimal supervision. He was quick at understanding the requirements of the project and was able to redevelop a new version of the web-based dicom image viewer in a very short amount of time, despite his limited experience with web development. This enabled the development of a prototype in a form that is now suitable for clincal development i.e. testing by physicians. The creation of this framework will help make the image-based workflow more efficient for physicians, and this is a significant achievement. He certainly exceeded all expectations required of a coop student.<br>
											Overall Parsa has done an excellent job during his co-op term. He is an expectional student with high quality work. He is a quick learner and has the capacity to understand the desired workflow in order to develop the right software tools for analysis. He is also very hard working, innovative and meticulous. Overall, I am extremely pleased with his performance."<br>

											"Parsa is very dedicated, humble, and understanding. He attempted really difficult challenges like the chatbot we were thinking of doing. If there was a post-doc working on the same stuff as Parsa and he had done half as much as him, I would have been more than satisfied. I guess this speaks volumes about Parsa's smartness. Parsa is very flexible, he always uses evidence to back up his arguments. He is not afraid to speak out his views, and this is awesome, because he often told us better ways to do things. He is also a very very fast learner. Parsa is very meticulous and sincere. I wish Parsa was not just an intern for one work term. I would have loved for him to work with us longer. He is awesome." <br>
